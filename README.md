# ChatAppUsingAESandAES


The **ChatAppUsingAESandAES** is designed to provide a secure and private chat experience with end-to-end encryption. This system ensures the confidentiality and integrity of messages, even on a server. It employs a combination of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption algorithms to protect passwords, private keys, and message content.

## Key Features

- **Double Encryption**: The system utilizes AES and RSA encryption to secure data at various levels.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages between clients are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring ultimate privacy.
- **Text and Image Support**: The system can handle both text and image data.
- **Robust Security**: AES and RSA encryption algorithms are known for their robust security and resistance to various attacks.
- **Key Management**: To establish 0 visibility of sensitive information on the server, private keys and passwords are encrypted.

## How It Works

1. **Client 1 to Client 2 Communication**: When Client 1 sends a message to Client 2, the message is first encrypted using the RSA algorithm. The server then receives the encrypted message and applies an additional layer of encryption using the AES algorithm.

2. **Client 2 Retrieves Messages**: When Client 2 polls the server for new messages from Client 1, the server decrypts the message using the AES algorithm. Client 2 needs to decrypt the message once again using Client 1's public key to recover the original message.

3. **Use of AES and RSA**: Both AES and RSA encryption algorithms are employed for text and image data, providing a flexible and robust encryption process.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Privacy**: The system addresses privacy concerns by implementing end-to-end encryption and double encryption of sensitive data.
- **Key Management**: The server is designed to keep private keys and sensitive information encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Key Exchange**: The challenge of securely exchanging private keys is addressed by using a combination of AES and RSA encryption, ensuring secure key management.
- **Public Key Security**: To protect the security of public keys, the system ensures that passwords are encrypted because a known password could compromise the public key.

## Future Improvements

The system can be further improved by adding features such as real-time message synchronization, support for additional data formats, and enhanced user management.
